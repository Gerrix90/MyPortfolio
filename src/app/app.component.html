      <hr>
      <p> I am a young IT enthuthiast who decided to dive into the exciting world of programming. I live in Nairobi, Kenya. I acquainted myself with coding skills from<a href="https://moringaschool.com/"> Moringa School</a>- A brilliant institution
        I should say. My intrinsic
        drive to do programming was inspired by wanting to discontinue a trend of constant consumerism; by learning how to give back to the community not only through creating brilliant Apps, but also teaching the skill to young aspiring computer
        programmers.<br>
    I am also a subtle self-taught artist <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hjtGKC5JUB8N9zLXGLn_JTIy1FCdR4cn"><strong>My art</strong></a> and in many ways <strong>art</strong> helped me in my amazing coding journey.It has helped me
        nature moral-excellencies like patience, gentleness, keenness and creativity.</p>
